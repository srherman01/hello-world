Help me learn java programming better so I can introduce it to students

I am a math teacher in Fairfax County, Virginia.  We decided to offer a CS (Java programming) course in our school and needed a math teacher to teach it.  I thought it would be a great opportunity for me to branch into a subject I've been interested in, as well as open up a subject area for students that I feel that they desparately need.  I have been loving the course so far and I feel that it is successfull, but there is lots of room for improvement.

We have great materials to work off of but I need to be taking steps to improve my own programming skills as well.

I have been trying to come up with personal projects for me to attempt and learn.  The more projects that I attempt and that are suggested to me, the better.
